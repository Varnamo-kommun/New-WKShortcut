<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In our organisation we have a lot of web applications. Migrating to eKlient and starting to utilize the powerful WrapperKing to package applications we found that it took a lot of time and with multiple persons handling the application packaging, there where sometimes disparities in how they performed - Hence, this application!


### Built With

* [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [WrapperKing](https://www.inera.se/tjanster/alla-tjanster-a-o/e-klient)
